    <string name="bio">A biography is meant to analyze a person’s life and interpret it as well.
        A good biographer will try to join the dots and explain certain actions and events that a certain figure was
        involved in.
        This will help in clearly bringing out the significance of a person’s life through their accomplishments or
        remarkable deeds.
        Biographies are usually written in a chronological order.
        Some biographers could also draft them in a themed order that is early life, educational background, a person’s
        achievements or accomplishments.
        But some especially the short ones will focus on one area in a person’s life.
        There are several sources of information that could aid one in writing an astounding biography.
        These sources of information can be grouped into either primary sources or secondary sources.
        The primary sources of information include materials like letters, newspaper accounts or diaries.
        A biographer can also make an arrangement to interview an individual they want to write about. This is also
        considered as a primary source of information.
        The secondary sources are reference books, other biographies or historical records that are related to the
        subject being written about.
